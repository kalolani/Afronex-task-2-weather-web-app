<h1>welcome to weather web app</h1>
<p margin-bottom="20px">this is a simple fully responsive and dynamic weather web application. By using this platform  users can see the weather conditions of their current location by clickig on the use location button.also users can just enter any city name and see the weekly weather forcast for that location.

<p>I used react js with tailwind css to develop this website, to get the weather data I used the openWeatherMap free API and to gather the current location of the user I used the popular Geolocation API provided by modern browsers</p>
